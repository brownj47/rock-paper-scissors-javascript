# Module 03 Mini-Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, I built a game of Rock paper scissors using only JavaScript. The game plays using dialog boxes. 

The deployed application can be found at the following link: https://brownj47.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-javascript/

For this activity, I had to learn about random numbers and picking random index items. I di my first implementation of functions. I learned about the math, alert, confirm, and prompt methods. 

## üí° Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [MDN Web Docs on window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)

* [MDN Web Docs on Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your group to further your knowledge:

* How can you customize the appearance of the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` dialog boxes?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
